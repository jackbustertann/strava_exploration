# Strava Data Exploration

## Motivation


## Data Collection

The dataset used for this project consists of performance metrics collected using the Garmin Forerunner 235 watch for over 200 running activities spanning between August 2018 and February 2020. This includes basic activity information, such as distances, times and average heart rates, along with more granular metrics for each km split. <br/><br/>
Also, to provide further scope for analysing race performances, weather data such as temperature, wind speed and weather icons were collected for each activity using individual requests to the Dark Sky API.
