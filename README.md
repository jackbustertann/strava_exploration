# Strava Data Exploration

## Motivation


## Data Collection

**Data Overview**

The dataset used for this project consists of performance metrics collected using my Garmin Forerunner 235 watch for over 200 running activities spanning from September 2018 - Present. This includes basic activity information, such as distances, times and average heart rates, along with more granular metrics for each km split. <br/><br/>
Also, to provide further scope for analysing race performances, weather data such as temperature, wind speed and weather icons were collected for each activity using individual requests to the Dark Sky API.
