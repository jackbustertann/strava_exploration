# Strava Data Exploration

## Motivation

The motivation for this project is to create a series of interactive dashboards using my personal running data to inform my training ahead of future running events. 

## Data Collection

**Data Overview**

The dataset used for this project consists of performance metrics collected using my Garmin Forerunner 235 watch for running activities spanning from January 2018 - Present. This includes a combination aggregate level information, such as total time elapsed and average heart rates, along with more granular information for each lap and heart rate zone. Also, for completeness, the locations for each activity (with coordinates) were collected using requests to the Google Geocoding API.
